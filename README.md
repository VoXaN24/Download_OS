# Download_OS
A little Python script for downloading some OS (wget module requiered)
How to install the wget module ?
pip3 install wget or pip install wget module

Language : French (only for the moment)

A rework of the script can be made ASAP (To be in accord to PCArchive) - ETA : None

It's based in the PCArchive.eu.org database (Another of my project :D )
